Sprint planning is one of the most critical ceremonies in Agile development. When done well, it sets the entire team up for success. When done poorly, it can derail an entire sprint.

## The Foundation: Backlog Refinement

Before sprint planning can be effective, your backlog must be well-groomed. This means:

- User stories are properly sized
- Acceptance criteria are clear
- Dependencies are identified
- Stories are prioritized

### Story Sizing Techniques

**Planning Poker** is a popular technique where team members estimate story points collaboratively. This helps:
- Surface different perspectives
- Identify areas of uncertainty
- Build team consensus

**T-Shirt Sizing** is a simpler approach using XS, S, M, L, XL categories. Great for early-stage estimation.

## Sprint Planning Agenda

A typical sprint planning session should follow this structure:

1. **Review Sprint Goal** (15 minutes)
   - What are we trying to achieve?
   - Why is this sprint important?

2. **Review Capacity** (10 minutes)
   - Team member availability
   - Holiday schedules
   - Other commitments

3. **Select Backlog Items** (30-60 minutes)
   - Pull stories from the backlog
   - Discuss requirements and acceptance criteria
   - Answer questions and clarify uncertainties

4. **Break Down Tasks** (30-60 minutes)
   - Decompose stories into tasks
   - Assign owners
   - Estimate effort

5. **Confirm Sprint Goal** (10 minutes)
   - Ensure all selected items align
   - Adjust if necessary

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Overcommitting**: Taking on too much work
2. **Under-planning**: Not breaking down stories enough
3. **Skipping refinement**: Coming to planning unprepared
4. **Ignoring capacity**: Not accounting for team availability

## Best Practices

- Time-box the meeting (usually 2-4 hours for a 2-week sprint)
- Include the entire team
- Keep the product owner available
- Document decisions and assumptions
- Review previous sprint velocity

## Conclusion

Effective sprint planning requires preparation, collaboration, and focus. By following these guidelines, you can run sprint planning sessions that energize your team and set them up for success.
